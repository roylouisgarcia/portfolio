## From being a MOOC deliverable to an actual site I loved:

This portfolio was built as a project for FreeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage). It is designed as a Single Page Application-like that should work well both on Desktop browsers and mobile devices. 

Since then, I try my best to keep this portfolio updated. Although, I may be tempted to create other versions of my portfolio using other technology that I learn as I progress in my career as a developer.
