                    <p class="typewriter teentoys">... As a boy, the toys I loved included many paper and pen games, the TI Speak N Spell, Game N Watch, the Connect 4 Game and others ... Early curiosity about how things work became a habit of questiong and perpetual learning. I often break my own toys, but I never throw them away. If I am not able to reassemble them, I try to create something new from them. It felt good to repurpose or even recycle old or broken items.</p>

                    <p class="typewriter teentoys">This curiosity continued even when I started learning about computers. Eventually, I added careful reading of instruction manuals as a skill to develop along with my curiosity. Being careful did not stop me from testing bounderies, As an example, when I was starting to learn about computers, the first time I accidentally opened a file that was meant for a Calendar program using Notepad, I made sure to remind myself to make backups of files that I wanted to tinker with. :)</p>

                <p>Life is full of obstacles. Seeking solutions instead of dwelling from problems is a virtue that my father reminded me before he passed away. As a first-generation immigrant, balancing family life and studies became a paramount skill and necessity. </p>
                <p>I learned to make use of technological tools and virtual communities for help. I remember using xanga blog account to host and share electronic pdfs of lectures nots and recorded mp3 audio of lectures that were approved and shared by professors. Back then, I only had my Palm Pilot and Sony Clie to record. Since then, technology became an extension that enabled me to persevere. I involved myself in projects that aims to provide solutions.

                            <p>Hartnell College has launched my interests in computing and its benefits to humanity. Initially, I wanted to major in Mathematics or Physics. After taking computer courses and actually using technology as aid to my studying, I decided to change my major to Computer Science. Since the overlap among these three majors were also the transfer requirements to bigger universities, I decided to get all three associate degrees. Also, I made most of my stay at Hartnell to get to know more about the experiences of some Computer Science faculty members and to network with peers.</p>

                <p>My professional career started in the Philippines. I worked as a payroll clerk for a construction company until my family's petition to move to the U.S. got approved. I then took various job positions. My first job in the U.S. was a seasonal job at the ATT Pebble Beach Gold tournament. Then I got hired full-time at Hometown Buffet. Since I needed to wait a year to be considered a California resident and get discounted tuition at a local community college, I took other part-time jobs at a local cinema and Sears. When schooling started, I kept one full-time job at Target Stores and went to school part-time.</p>
                <p> After a few computer courses, I started working as a freelancer doing web design, development, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). To give back to the community, most of my first clients explored solutions that were considered cost-effective tools that are considered Free and open-source software (FOSS). I took the role of a temporary in-house developer, a consultant, or an on-demand administrator. As a freelancer/entrepreneur developer, I used "white label branding" in order to differentiate myself from other developers. I provided enough documentation and training to my clients' employees to empower them to maintain their own site. These FOSS tools, like Joomla, Drupal, Moodle, GIMP, etc. </p>
                <p>After getting my bachelors degree, I started working for my alma mater, CSUMB. I was hired as their Student Information Systems Analyst. I was involved in the design, implementation and documentation of PeopleSoft 8.9 security for the Student Administration of the university. I helped design and migrate security set-ups for both the development and production environment. I maintained user accounts, administer security roles and created a FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974) training course for employees who needed access to sensitive student records.</p>

                <p>As a developer, I learned use tools to collaborate with other developers. I also learned up-to-date tools and techniques in order to stay competitive in the development business. I enrolled in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and joined Meet Up communities of fellow developers and freelancers.</p>

                <p>In working with virtual teams, I learned collaborative tools like versioning, remote desktop sharing, client management tools and others. I also delegated most of my projects to upcoming developers, so I can concentrate on client sales and acquisition. I also needed time since I started pursuing my master degree. </p>
                <p>In learning the newest, I worked on personal projects. I invested some time and effort to create my own development machines as sandbox for web development, programming, and penetration testing. I had the chance to use my creativity in creating contents, placeholders, and some deliverables. I used my own songs and compositions to create video and audio contents to support web development.</p>
