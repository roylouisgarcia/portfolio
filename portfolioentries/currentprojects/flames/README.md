# FLAMES: Relationship Predictor

This is an HTML, JAVASCRIPT, AND CSS implementation of a game that accepts two names and returns a relationship prediction based on the number of common letters. View the project (here)[https://roylouislgarcia.github.io/portfolioentries/currentprojects/flames/]

## Installation

Viewing in a browser that supports HTML, Javascript and CSS is minmum requirement

## Usage

1. Enter two names
2. Let the app process these inputs (see note below regarding pending improvement plans)
3. Follow the story line of the app

## History

*There are versions of these app that uses java and ruby. This one is a simple javascript implementation*

## Future Development Pending

As of early 2018, the "process" used to come up with the output (or "relationship prediction") is based on counting the common letters that the names have.

My research suggests other ways of arriving at a result. One way is to remove the common letters and count what will remain from each name. 

These two approaches can be incorporated in this project and provide options to the users
